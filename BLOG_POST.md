# What Drives Developer Salaries?
*Insights from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey*

Talking about pay is hard, but data helps. Using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, I set out to answer a simple question: **what most strongly influences a developer’s annual salary?** I focused on a handful of practical questions and kept the analysis transparent.

**Questions of interest**
1) What does the salary distribution look like?  
2) How does years of professional experience relate to pay?  
3) Do remote roles differ from on‑site roles?  
4) Does company size matter?  
5) Which factors stand out overall?

**What I found**
- Salaries are **right‑skewed** with a long tail. Most developers cluster in a middle band, with outliers far above the median. Visualizing histograms and boxplots helps set realistic expectations.
- **Experience matters**, especially early on. Returns appear to **diminish** at higher experience levels—growth continues, but the slope gets gentler.
- **Remote vs. on‑site** varies by country and role. Remote respondents often report higher pay in some regions, but **location effects dominate**—it’s not a one‑size‑fits‑all story.
- **Company size** tends to trend higher for mid‑to‑large organizations, though start‑ups can spike for certain roles.

**Limitations**
This is self‑reported survey data and reflects the sample who responded. Results can vary across years and geographies, so treat conclusions as directional, not definitive.
